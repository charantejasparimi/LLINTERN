# LLINTERN
Welcome to the LLINTERN repository! This repository contains two distinct web application projects: 
a Tic-Tac-Toe game and a 
Weather Forecasting app. Both projects are focused on front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing interactive and engaging user experiences.
