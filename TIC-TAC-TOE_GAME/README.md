Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game project! This is a web application developed using React and Vite, designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience for users. The game allows two players to take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid with the objective of getting three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. This project emphasizes front-end development and is an excellent way to practice React and state management.

The Tic-Tac-Toe Game comes with several features to enhance user experience. It supports multiplayer mode, enabling two players to play the game on the same device. The interface is interactive, allowing players to click on the grid to place their marks. The game includes logic to detect winning combinations after each move and announces the winner. Additionally, if all squares are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw. A reset functionality is also provided, allowing players to start a new game easily.

The project leverages a range of technologies. React is used as the primary JavaScript library for building the user interface, while Vite is utilized for fast and efficient front-end tooling. HTML structures the app interface and organizes the content, and CSS styles the layout and elements for a visually appealing design.
