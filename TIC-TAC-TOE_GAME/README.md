# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game project! This project is a web application built using React and Vite. The game allows two players to take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid with the objective of getting three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. This project focuses on front-end development and is a great way to practice React and state management.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Mode:** Two players can play the game on the same device.
- **Interactive Interface:** Players can click on the grid to place their marks.
- **Win Detection:** The game checks for winning combinations after each move and announces the winner.
- **Draw Detection:** If all squares are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
- **Reset Functionality:** Players can reset the game to start over.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** Next-generation front-end tooling to build and serve the project.
- **HTML:** Structures the app interface and organizes content.
- **CSS:** Styles the layout and elements for an aesthetically pleasing design.
